1.I managed to understand how recursion works in this lab. I also managed to change code so various parameters can be changed. One thing that was hard to do was trace the recursion as it gets really complicated. I found that using recursion trees to trace the code which helped me understand how it was working.

2.
The questions answered here are answered if the command towers(5,2,3) is invoked. 
1. The code will try to solve the hanoi problem for n-1 disks. In this case, it will be n-1 disks.
towers (4,2,3)

2.There will be 61 recursive calls made.

3. 2 3 will be printed to stdout. Move #1: was From Tower 2 to Tower 3.

4. towers (3,2,3)

The questions answered here are answered if the command towers(8,1,2) is invoked. 
There will be 255 lines printed to stdout.
