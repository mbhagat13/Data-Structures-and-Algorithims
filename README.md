# Data-Structures-and-Algorithims

The labs in this repo relate to the Data Structures and Algorithims course at Ryerson University.

The course deals with the following topics:

1. Structured methods for engineering software design

2. Process of the problem-to-program and an introduction to "big O" and "big Omega" notation.

3. Principal internal sorting algorithms: quicksort, heapsort, binsort, and the simpler, less efficient methods such as insertion sort. Linear-time algorithms are also covered.

4. Traditional list, stack and queue structures. Also, mapping an abstract data type based on the mathematical notion of a function.

5. Introduction to abstract data types based on the mathematical model of a set. Implementations of stacks and queues. Introduction to hash tables and binary search trees.

6. Graphs, including directed and undirected graphs, for the implementation of graph algorithms. Introduction to data structures for graph representation. Presentation of a number of graph algorithms, including depth-first search, generating minimal spanning trees, shortest paths, etc.

7. Asymptotic analysis of recursive procedures, including recurrence relations.
 
8. Introduction to designing algorithms, dynamic programming, local search algorithms, and various forms of tree searching.
 
9. Analysis of algorithm complexity.
